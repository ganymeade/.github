## What is Ganymeade?

> Inspired by traditional tabletop role playing games. Finally brought to the modern, digital world.

Ganymeade is a heavily in-development, setting-agnostic, asynchronous online roleplaying system that does require a Game Master (referee), but one that has a significantly smaller required workload than a traditional tabletop role playing game's GM. The system is also designed to support vastly more players in a single, inter-connected story than a traditional system might.

<!-- TODO-STABLE: Add link to official instance -->

Ganymeade is designed such that it is easy to use for any end-user with even a small amount of technical knowledge, while still making fundamental use of some key potential advantages to be found in a **fully online** roleplaying system. The recommended way to get started with ganymeade is via [the official web frontend](https://github.com/ganymeade/web).

<!-- TODO-SOON: Come up with a good name for the 'modules' -->
<!-- TODO-STABLE: Reference and explain recommended modules repository -->

Ganymeade is extremely setting-agnostic, even, in a way, system-agnostic, beyond some basic concepts. Everything beyond utter fundamentals is implemented via optional, configurable and combinable modules that are selected and configured when creating a game. Via this organisational system, the trade-off one might be met with when dealing with more traditional setting-agnostic roleplaying systems is eliminated. Rather than exchanging a well-fitting ruleset for being able to more easily do what you want, you get the best of both worlds: You customize the ruleset using pre-made (or your own) modules **and** you get as much fine-grained control over the setting as your heart could desire.

## Why the name?

> Have you considered that it _does_ just sound kind of cool?

The initial idea for the name started as just Ganymede. This was inspired as an adaptation of the name 'Callisto', a key [inspiration](#inspiration) of this project (with Callisto being Jupiter's second-largest moon after Ganymede). The only issue seen with the name was that it may make the project seem, at first glance, like a purely sci-fi oriented design. The word mead is commonly used in fantasy settings. Similarly to how naming one of Jupiter's moons could draw the mind to sci-fi, using the word mead can often draw one's mind to fantasy. Combining the two makes the project seem more general, or, at least, more detached from an existing connotation.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by some others. The most obvious would be traditional tabletop role-playing games and play-by-post roleplaying games, of course. Following that, this project is inspired by a small play-my-mail system designed for use in emails entitled [Callisto](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/126704/Callisto). The idea for this project would've been unlikely to spawn without it.

## Contributing

<!-- TODO-STABLE: Expand upon "Better yet, show them!" below -->

> Even if you lack any of the technical skill to make contributions to the project formally, word-of-mouth advertising does a lot! Tell your friends about this 'cool project that you found' and let it spread. Better yet, show them! Maybe one of them will be able to contribute more formally.

<!-- TODO-SOON: Provide clearer, more formal contributing instructions - CONTRIBUTING.md? -->

As the project is currently in it's incredibly early stages, A formal contribution path is lacked. Feel free to get into contact with me (@CHATALOT1 on Github) if you would like to help in this stage. Creating a GitHub issue on this repo should do to get my attention.
